This command adds the environment locally at ~/.if0/.environments/gitlab.com/test-env.

If GL_TOKEN is set in ~/.if0/if0.env, a private GitLab project is created, 
and the local environment is synced with it. In this case a repo url is not needed.

If a repo url is provided, the repository present at the remote repository url is cloned locally.
If there is no GL_TOKEN and no repo url, only a local copy is created at ~/.if0/.environments`,
